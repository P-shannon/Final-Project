		<p class="article">This will be the focus of your purchase, your ship will hold everything you buy except other ships. The armor density value describes how much of a punch the outer hull can withstand before it begins to buckle. The Cargo capacity is how much your ship can hold, equipped modules do not consume cargo space, there's designated areas for those. The weapon hardpoint value dictates how many weapons the vessel can hold. Unfortunately Lorem Ipsum Astronautics do not sell vessel armaments, but we do vend armed drones. Drone Control Frequencies is how many drones your vessel's onboard computer can control simultaneously. The Generator Hardpoints value is how many generators you have installed in your ship.</p>

		<center><h2>Generators</h2></center>
		<div class="articleImage"><img src="../images/gen1.jpg"></div>
		<p class="article">The ship generator is in charge of creating and storing useable energy for the ship's various systems including navigation, life support and propulsion. It's also in charge of projecting a temporary shield around the vessel to protect it during dangerous situations. The Capacity value is the maximum amount of energy units it can store before it can no longer produce new energy. Power/minute is how much energy it can produce in a minute. Shield output/Sec is how many shield point units the generator can project in a second. Shield density is how strong the shield that's projected is. Shields with high output but low density refill quickly, but can be penetrated easier; whereas shields with low output and high density don't begin blocking damage until it reaches a suitable threshold. The boost value is the degree of which it increases all stats in boost mode. Boost mode consumes as much more fuel as the degree of boosting.</p>

		<center><h2>Propulsion</h2></center>
		<div class="articleImage" style="height:144px;margin-bottom: 5px;"><img src="../images/propul1.jpg"></div>
		<p class="article">Propulsion systems allow locomotion in the void of space. They come as a set, mixing and matching parts is ill advised. The thrust value illustrates how much push the propulsion system can provide. Energy consumption is the general energy efficiency rating of the system. Higher values mean more energy consumed. Boost is degree of which the thrust is multiplied in boost mode. Energy consumption and heat also increases in boost mode. The heat capacity is how hot the propulsion system can get before it hits critical condition. The system produces heat during operation and it's important to let the ship's internal heat sink systems cool it off. The Armor value is how much kinetic damage the various thrusters can take before they disable or worse. Unfortunately the propulsion system is the primary target for pirates and it's important to make sure they're well defended.</p>

		<center><h2>Drones</h2></center>
		<div class="articleImage"><img src="../images/drone1.jpg"></div>
		<p class="article">Drones are small, unmanned machines that typically serve a simple and specific purpose. Every vessel is greatly improved by the presence of drones. Activity Radius is how far away a drone can go from you and still remain functional. Operation time is how long a drone can stay operational in one launch. Speed is how fast it can move measured in Kilometers per second. The Armor value is how much damage the drone can sustain before becoming non functional. Offensive ability is a metric for showing how well the drone can fight. Not all drones are designed for fighting.</p>
